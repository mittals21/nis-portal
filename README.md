# Content Management System Documentation

## Project Overview

The content management system (CMS) for NIS Portal is a web application designed to manage and organize study material for educational purposes. It provides two different authority levels: admin and user. Admins can add, edit, or delete study material, while users can only view and access the resources.

The study material is structured into two sections: senior division and senior wing. Each section contains modules or topics, and each topic contains various types of content such as videos, text, presentations, etc.

## Modules and Functionality

1. **Authentication Module**:
   - Description: Handles user authentication using Firebase Authentication.
   - Technologies: Firebase Authentication.
   - Workflow: Allows users to sign up, sign in, and manage their accounts securely.

2. **Admin Panel Module**:
   - Description: Allows admins to manage study material and user roles.
   - Technologies: React, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore.
   - Workflow: Admins can add, edit, or delete study material. 

3. **User Dashboard Module**:
   - Description: Allows users to view and access study material.
   - Technologies: React, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore.
   - Workflow: Users can view study material organized by senior division and senior wings. They can select a section to view modules/topics and access the content.

4. **Study Material Structure Module**:
   - Description: Defines the structure of study material.
   - Technologies: Firebase Firestore.
   - Workflow: Study material is organized into senior division and senior wings, each containing modules/topics. Admins can add, edit, or delete modules/topics and their content.

## System Architecture

- **Frontend**:
  - Built with React for UI components.
  - Styled with Tailwind CSS.
  - State managed with Redux.

- **Backend**:
  - Firebase for authentication (Firebase Authentication).
  - Firebase Firestore for storing study material data.
  - Firebase Storage for storing multimedia content.

- **Communication**:
  - Frontend communicates with Firebase services using Firebase SDKs.

- **Security**:
  - Firebase Authentication for user authentication.
  - Firebase Security Rules to restrict access to study material based on user roles.

## Deployment

- Frontend: Deployed to Firebase Hosting or Netlify.
- Backend: Firebase Functions for backend logic.

## Conclusion

The content management system provides a robust solution for managing educational study material. It offers a user-friendly interface for admins to manage content and for users to access resources securely. The use of Firebase for authentication, database, and storage ensures scalability, security, and performance.
